# 2.1 The Science of Sound: Fundamental Principles
*Some essential concepts and terms*

**What is Sound?** Is it a *physical* phenomenon (a vibration through a medium)? Or is it a *perceptual* phenomenon (the product of our nervous system and neural processes)? *Is it both?*

What is the difference between hearing and listening? Is it just about our ears? Can ordinary sounds be "musical?"

Many of the great pioneers of electronic and computer music (Pauline Oliveros, Alvin Lucier, Edgard Varese, etc.)  were motivated more by these questions and by the quest for a "deep listening" experience than they ever were by the novelty of their electronic gadgets.

The attraction for many seems to be that electronic and digital technologies give us a unique window into the fundamental nature of sound. Technology has an ability to reveal truths about the physical world that we might feel, but are difficult to capture, describe, or express.

However, we're going to start with the basics. Sound, as commonly understood, has some basic characteristics. There is a vocabulary that we use to describe sounds that you will need to get familiar with in order to get into the details of how sound is produced and represented in the digital realm.
