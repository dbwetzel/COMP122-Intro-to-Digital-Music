# The Art of Sound: Listening, and therefore making music
*Technology reveals new music*

Digital Music (or if you prefer, Computer Music) depends on a lot of science, math, engineering, and technology, but ultimately it's about creativity and human expression of ideas and feelings through sound. Sure, there are a lot of discoveries and technical papers that come out of Computer Music (CM) research, but the main activity is composition, performance, and the design of new instruments, tools, and ways of *listening*. 

This introduction to digital music isn't just about the weird sounds and gadgets and technology for technology's sake. There is a reason why some of us are so drawn to a medium that requires hours and hours of tedious work in order to make the simplest sounds and knit them into something we can call "music." For most of us in this field, it starts with a fascination with sound and some of the bigger ideas of the universe that we encounter through music. For many musicians, music and sound are a conduit to the sublime.

To truly understand music, or the world around you, you have to learn to listen differently. **Active listening** is a discipline. It requires you to pay attention to things in ways you hadn't considered before. 

### Active listening exposes you to the unexpected, and this is how discoveries are made.
