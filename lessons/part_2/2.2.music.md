# 2.1 Turning Sound into Music

In the early 1940s, composers in Europe, notably Pierre Schaffer, Edgard Varèse, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, began to use tape recorders as a creative compositional tool. A new musical medium, the "tape composition" was born. Schaeffer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te" target="_blank">*Musique concrète*</a>, in which recorded or electronic sounds were spliced into a sound collage that manipulated and obscured the sources. The normal rules of harmony, rhythm, and melody didn't apply. Instead the sounds themselves directed the compositional choices, and works in this genre followed their own internal logic. 

In the 1970s, the first Hip Hop DJs used vinyl records to isolate beats and weave new textures out of pre-existing music (mainly funk and R&B) as a platform for Rap artists. The same was true of the first House DJs int he early 1980s, creating layers and unending musical dance grooves from old Disco records.

All of this was done in the analog realm until the mid to late 1980s, when digital audio and MIDI changed everything.
