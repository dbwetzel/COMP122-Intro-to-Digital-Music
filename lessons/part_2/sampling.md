# 2. The Art of Sampling

Here we get to use one of my favorite words: disambiguation! The word "sampling" gets used in this course in two senses:

1. the discreet measurement of a waveform in a digital audio encoding system (e.g. sampling rates, 16-bit sample size, etc.)

2. the use of short recorded audio segments or clips as compositional raw material for music production

Sampling (using short recorded sounds as musical raw material) is a foundational principle in electronic and computer music. Hip Hop is the genre that has done the most to popularize the concept of sampling, but it is not the first or only place this technique shows up in the musical universe.

## Hip Hop and break-beat Sampling
*Re-purposing existing music & sound for a new creative context*

The art of sampling as we know it grew out of early Hip Hop (1970s onward), but as a technique it has found its way into nearly every genre and style. This is largely due to digital sampling tools that became widely available in the late 1980s. 

Early Hip Hop DJs found break beats (short drum solos, or "breaks") on vinyl records that they would extend through manipulation of the turntable by hand and by ear. The sources for a lot of early Hip Hop break-beats were from Sould and Disco records from the 1960s and 70s. Many DJs still practice the art of spinning and scratching vinyl. The extended break-beat was formative to Hip Hop. It became the platform for rappers and break dancers, setting the direction for the art form we know as Hip Hop today.

Here's the originator, DJ Kool Herc, explaining the "Merry-Go-Round" technique:

## Samplers

In the 1980s, instrument makers, mainly in Japan, began producing digital samplers that were affordable and capable of storing, arranging, layering, and processing short sound files. This development made sampling far more accessible. Digital samplers, such as the legenday Akai MPC, allowed DJs to capture multiple samples for immediate playback from a sensor pad (a square touch-sensitive trigger). In this way, the sampler became an *instrument* and new performance techniques developed accordingly. Many electronic keyboards of the late 1980s and early 90s had sampling capabilities, and samplers such as the Akai S1000 were designed for mapping samples across the piano keyboard. These devices were stand-alone hardware units, but they were MIDI compatible, meaning they could be networked with other digital instruments and even computer-based sequencers.

## Software sampling 

Modern sampling in electronic music (descendents of House, Techno and its variations) is mostly done in software (Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, etc.). Sampling in software doesn't require the same physical technique as Kool Herc's turntable performance, but it affords a greater range of sample manipulation (chopping, filtering, layering) that would be possible working with a linear medium like vinyl. Instead, sound files can be accessed randomly, layered, re-ordered, and transformed in ways that turn a sound into something completely different. Most electronic music producers will combine samples with synthesized elements, various effects processors, addition sound effects layers, and original instrumental or vocal tracks.
