# 2. Who Sampled?
*Online resource for tracking down and comparing sample sources*

Who Sampled (.com) has an exhaustive database of songs with samples in them and songs that have been sampled. All are cross-referenced and linked so that you can find the original sources or find the locations where samples appear. It's an amazing resource for studying the sampling ecology across genres and time.
