# 2.1.2 Frequency/Pitch

Certain sounds are made up of continuous vibration of air molecules. Our hand clap example could be considered an "impulse" type sound - a sudden "transient" noise with no sustained vibration. It's a momentary spike in air pressure that you perceive as a short, sharp "pop."

A violin, on the other hand, creates sound mainly by drawing a bow across a string. The bow applies friction to the string, causing it to vibrate, or **oscillate**, back and forth rapidly, hundreds of times per second. When it does so, it creates a regular series of pressure waves evenly distributed in time and space. We can measure the frequency of those vibrations, and we perceive that frequency as a pitch. If that violin is playing a note with a frequency of 440 vibrations per second (440 Hertz or Hz), it would match the pitch 'A' above middle 'C' on the piano.
