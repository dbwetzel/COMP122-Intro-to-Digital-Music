# Pauline Oliveros: Deep Listening


> "Take a walk at night. Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears." - Pauline Oliveros, Sonic Meditations

Pauline Oliveros (1932-2016) was an American composer and accordionist, and one of the most influential figures in late 20th-century experimental and electronic music. She was a foundeer of the San Fransisco Tape Music Center in the 1960s.

She is perhaps best know for her theories of listening and her advocacy for "Sonic Awareness" and "Deep Listening." As a composer, she advocated listening and meditation as a form of experiemntation on the self. The musical tones were osften more of a byproduct of an intentional practice of drawing one's awareness to sound, the environment, and oneself.

Oliveros coined the term "Deep Listening" after decending into an inderground cistern in Port Townsend, Washington to record herself improvising with a group of musicians. That group of musicians formed the "Deep Listening Band" and the concept of Deep Listening became Oliveros' most known work and legacy. Today, the Deep Listening Institute at Rennsaleer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Albany, NY hosts Deep Listening retreats for meditation and sonic awareness.
