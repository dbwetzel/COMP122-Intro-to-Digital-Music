# 2.1.5 Timbre

So far we have talked about pitched sounds in terms of a single frequency, but most pitched sounds you will hear have a more complex blend of frequencies. For instance, a violin tone at 440 Hz also contains  energy at 880 hz, 1760 Hz, 3520 Hz, and so on. These "overtones" are present in the sound, but not as prominent as the lowest, or "fundamental," tone. They blend together to give the violin it's unique *timbre*, or "tone color."

The frequencies that make up the overtones of most pitched instruments are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. In that way they are said to be "harmonically" related. So we talk about the overtone series and the harmonics of a note more or less interchangably.

Why are overtones usually harmonically related to the fundamental frequency? Well, imagine a string, attached to the instrument at both ends ("nodes"). Pluck that string and it oscillates back and forth with a wavelength that is twice its length (from one node to another is half a wave). But that string can also simultaneously vibrate at the next available mode (just like a room resonance), which is exactly twice the fundamental (a node at each end and in the middle). Likewise, it resonates at the next mode (1/3 the wavelength or 3 times the fundamental), and the next (1/4 Î» or 4 * *f*), and so on.

Wind instruments operate in a similar fashion, but the tubes that make up their bodies act as resonating air chambers (like a room). Therefore, wind and brass instruments have timbres that also rely on the harmonic series in varying combinations. The human singing voice works on the same basic principle (your head and mouth are the resonators).

The exception is generally in the world of metallic percussion, such as bells and cymbals, in which many unrelated frequencies may resonate simultaneously. The term for this kind of timbre is "inharmonicity" since the different modes are not simple multiples of a clear fundamental frequency.
