# 1.2.4 John Cage: 4' 33"

*John Cage and the Music of Silence*

What kind of music emerges when there is no music?

In 1952, John Cage published his famous composition 4' 33" (four minutes, thirty-three seconds). It is in three movements (sections) with durations of 30 seconds, two minutes and 23 seconds, and 40 seconds. Each movement is marked "tacet" (no one plays an instrument). This implies a work that is totally silent, yet total silence is impossible. So what is it? Cage considered it experimental and an attempt to challenge standard notions of what constitutes music with ideas stemming from Zen Buddhism.

So if an audience sits in a concert hall for 30 seconds. How quiet can they be? If they're listening, what are they hearing? If it's intentional group listening, in a concert hall, for a fixed duration, is it music?

This is the musical work that starts fights in music theory classes (ask me how I know). Is it music? If a "musical" work contains no specific audible sounds, is it music? Where is the base line?
