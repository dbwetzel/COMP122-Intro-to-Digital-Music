# Digital Music is for Everyone
*How does the "non" musician or non-programmer participate?*

Digital technology in music has always had this promise of expanding our horizons. 

Once upon a time, computer music was the domain of highly trained specialists toiling away in obscure studios making noises that most people found weird. Those pioneers were looking for the edges of possibility when it came to sonic timbre, control, and organizational complexity. 

Then digital music technology went main stream sometime in the 1980s (with the advent of MIDI), and suddenly the ability to create and play didn't require a PhD in mathematics any more. Every decade since has seen an increase in access to more and more powerful musical production tools, to the point where bedroom producers with a laptop and some microphones can compete with the big-time studios for space on your playlist. 

In the past ten years, another quiet revolution has been brewing with the advent of the Web Audio API -- a set of web browser capabilities for sound generation and processing that has the potential to put sophisticated digital music creative tools in the hands of anyone with a web browser. Web developers can build complex musical web-apps with nothing more than some JavaScript code attached to a web page. That last innovation makes this class possible.
