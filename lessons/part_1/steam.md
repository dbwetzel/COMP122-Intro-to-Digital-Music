# STEAM Education
*Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS, and Mathematics*

**Why are the Arts important?** Why not concentrate on "practical" subjects like science and math, and leave the "extra" *artsy* stuff to the handful of dreamers and privileged types that can afford it?

**Here's a better question** - Why aren't the arts *central* to our exploration of technical subjects? 

After all, the creation of art often requires at least some contact with disciplines typically considered part of STEM. In any computer-based art form, that is especially true. 

In order to create music with a computer, you will need to define the sounds, specify parameters, and possibly develop algorithms to guide the generation of musical ideas. It also requires a basic understanding of the science of sound and some understanding of the theoretical concepts upon which it rests. 

Therefore, digital music (or "computer music," "music technology," "electroacoustic music," or whatever you want to call it) is inherently a "STEAM" subject. Digital Music isn't just a way to dress up the dry study of computer science and audio theory. 

**In Digital Music, the point is to make something musical and expressive.** The rest (the science, technology, engineering, and math) follows according to the requirements of the artistic vision or task.
