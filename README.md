*Learning materials and examples for an introductory course in Digital Music*

**David B. Wetzel, August 2025**

This is a set of materials for "Introduction to Digital Music" (COMP 122) a course developed at <a href="https://luc.edu" target="_blank">Loyola University Chicago</a> for all majors as part of the "Quantitative Awareness" category of the University Core Curriculum. It is intended as a gentle introduction to the art of computer music through the lens of online music produciton and programming exercised, critical listening, and exploration of online resources. No prior experience in computer programming or music is required.

This web site is a collection of the tutorials, examples, assignments, and code templates I have developed over the past nine years of teaching this course.
